# academicd_hub
AcademicHub is a full-stack file-sharing platform built for educational institutions, enabling teachers and students to securely upload, download, and access study materials. With role-based access, teachers can upload files categorized by subject, and students can easily find and download resources.

The platform automatically converts uploaded files (PPT, DOC, images) into PDF format to ensure compatibility and consistency across devices. It features secure user authentication using JWT and bcrypt, along with functionalities like password updates and form validation.

AcademicHub is structured using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, ensuring clean, modular, and maintainable code. The backend is developed using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, while the frontend is rendered with HBS (Handlebars) templating.
